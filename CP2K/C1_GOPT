Steps for electronic structure calculation
- Create an input as Input-GEO_OPT (see attached file)
- Create a run as pbs or slurm (see attached file, CP2K.sh)
- Submit the run as "qsub CP2K.sh" for pbs / "sbatch CP2K.sh" for slurm
- Generate an output as Output-GEO_OPT.out (see attached file)
- Keep necessary files in each calc. i.e. GTH_POTENTIALS, BASIS_MOLOPT, dftd3
- Keep "StructureInUse.xyz" file as an input geometry / system of interest

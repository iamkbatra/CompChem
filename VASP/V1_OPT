Steps for electronic structure calculation
- Create an input as "INCAR" (see attached file)
- Set k-points as "KPOINTS" (see attached file)
- Create a "POSCAR" includes lattice geometry and the atomic positions (see attached file)
- Generate "POTCAR" contains the pseudopotential for each atomic species (see attached file) 
- Create a run as pbs or slurm (see attached file, vasp.sh)
- Submit the run as "qsub vasp.sh" for pbs / "sbatch vasp.sh" for slurm
- Generate an output as OUTCAR (see attached file)
- Final optimized coordinates can be obtained as CONTCAR (see attached file)
- One must have these ".." 4 files in order to get started.
